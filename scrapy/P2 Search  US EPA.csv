According to the MSDS supplied by Ecolab, Inc., AC-55-5 Red contains 38% nitric acid by weight and Passivation Acid contains 23% nitric acid by weight. These chemicals are used to clean process tanks and vessels then discharged to a 21,352-gallon onsite wastewater equalization tank. The wastewater is pH neutralized in the tank through active chemical addition and then batch discharged to the Concord Wastewater Treatment Facility three to four times each production day. Use of the sanitizing agents and neutralization in the wastewater equalization tank dissociates the nitric acid into nitrate compounds and it is assumed that all of the nitric acid is treated onsite. Based on the quantities of nitric acid used, we calculate that HP Hood produced approximately 9,891 lbs of NaNO3 onsite during calendar year 2014, which is less than the 25,000 lb threshold for manufacture.","//enviro.epa.gov/enviro/P2_EF_Query.p2_report?FacilityId=03301WKSDR330NO&ChemicalId=0007697372&ReportingYear=2014&DocCtrlNum=1314212792636&Opt=0"

When compared to production volumes, this resulted in a 9.1% increase in pounds of recycling per gallon of product manufactured.

These containers are being emptied and crushed by mechanical means for collection in a dedicated compactor that is now being sent to our recycling facility.  Recycled plastic volumes are expected to increase substantially.Other Environmental Practices: General Environmental Management  - The Agawam Plant has completed carbon footprint evaluations for CY 2011 through CY 2014 utilizing the Dairy Plant Smart tool.  The carbon footprint results for Agawam were below the U.S. average for dairy manufacturing all 4 years evaluated.  The site's carbon footprint results (emissions per gallon of product) dropped by 16% from CY 2012 to CY 2013 and another 9% from CY 2013 to CY 2014.Other Environmental Practices: Energy Recovery  - Improvements in energy reduction continue.

Total natural gas usage reduced 3.1% for CY 2014 vs. CY 2013 which equates to a 1.7% reduction in mmBTU used per gallon of product.

However, the use of chemicals containing nitric acid was slightly higher (5.4%) in 2015 due to the installation of several new pieces of dairy processing equipment at the plant.  This equipment requires acid passivation and cleaning prior to being placed into service to ensure product quality and consumer safety. The chemicals utilized for this are the primary source of nitric acid use at the plant.  Additional opportunities to reduce nitric acid use at the site have been identified and will be tested during 2016.

In an attempt to reduce our use of this chemical, the Production Department modified the processing schedule to minimize the use of one of our three pasteurizing units and place more production on the other two.  This reduced the total number of cleaning cycles required for the three pasteurizers each week.  In addition, we use this chemical to clean one of the plant's seven filling machines.  A trial was conducted using one of our other sanitation chemicals that does not contain nitric acid to see if a permanent change was possible.  This trial also contributed to the reduction in our use of nitric acid during 2019 but we began to experience quality issues and had to resume use of the Acid Plus for this application. Methods to Identify SR Opportunities: T04 : PARTICIPATIVE TEAM MANAGEMENT - Our site is covered by the State of Massachusetts Toxics Use Reduction Act (TURA), which requires facilities to explore options to reduce the use of chemicals in their operations.  As part of this program, we have a team of employees from multiple different departments that meets periodically to brainstorm and evaluate various chemical reduction ideas.  In addition, we have a sanitation committee that meets every other week to track progress and discuss multiple items related to the cleaning of our plant and equipment, including the use of sanitation chemicals.   Source Reduction: Source Reduction  - The Agawam Plant has undertaken several measures over the last 8 years to reduce toxic chemical use as part of the Massachusetts Toxic Use Reduction Act (TURA) requirements and has achieved success in multiple areas with multiple chemicals.  In addition, a new sanitation chemical supplier began service at the site in March 2016.  The new supplier has conducted several optimization reviews with employees to identify areas for additional chemical reduction.  These reviews have resulted in shorter cleaning cycle times and a reduction in chemical concentrations.  Several projects have also been conducted at the site to remove unnecessary piping and equipment, reduce the lengths of existing piping to improve operational efficiency, and re-use final step cleaning and rinse liquids in the initial step of subsequent cleaning events.  The site has achieved the greatest success in the reduction of nitric acid use, as this is a primary component of multiple sanitation chemicals.  This has the added benefit of reducing the site's generation of nitrate compounds to levels below reportable quantities for multiple years since 2012.  The quantities of several other chemicals have also been reduced at the site.  This was due largely to the optimization measures taken and replacement of some sanitation chemicals with products using other components.

Ongoing improvement of cleaning techniques and employee attention to details.Other Environmental Practices: The plant operates and maintains an onsite waste water treatment facility which consists of an SBR system, storage lagoon, and a spray irrigation field.  The waste stream from the plant first enters an equalization tank where all of the waste product, washes, rinses, and floor drains are contained and diluted with water which stabilizes pH between 6.5 to 8.5 before being pumped into the batch SBR.  After the SBR cycle finishes the treated waste water is pumped into the storage lagoon and used to spray irrigate a crop field where the crop is removed several times per year for further nutrient removal.  Monthly testing is completed and reported through NETDMR as per our discharge permit requirements.","//enviro.epa.gov/enviro/P2_EF_Query.p2_report?FacilityId=21750JFFRS14738&ChemicalId=0007697372&ReportingYear=2021&DocCtrlNum=1321219704715&Opt=0"
